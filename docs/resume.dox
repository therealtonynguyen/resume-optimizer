@section experience EXPERIENCE

@subsection sn ServiceNow — Director of Software Engineering (San Diego, CA | 2018–Present)

Led global engineering organization responsible for shared platforms and engineering systems used across dozens of product teams.

@subsubsection sn_ux UX Development & Design Systems
- Led platform-level frontend architecture modernization, moving legacy UI frameworks to scalable, component-driven architecture using Web Components, React, and TypeScript across multiple product surfaces
- Established reusable UI platform patterns that unified interaction models across data-heavy surfaces such as lists, task boards, and workflow-driven consoles used by millions of enterprise users
- Drove consistency across surfaces by defining shared frontend infrastructure, state management approaches, and performance standards to ensure sustainable architecture at scale
- Partnered with platform and API teams to align frontend architecture with service-layer contracts, enabling scalable integration patterns and consistent data-fetching models across applications
- Led development of a cross-product design system with reusable, configurable UI components and accessibility standards, enabling teams to deliver features faster while maintaining visual and interaction consistency
- Built extensible component libraries that supported customization at product level while preserving platform coherence, reducing duplication and long-term maintenance costs
- Championed performance optimization and rendering efficiency initiatives across the UI platform, improving load times and runtime responsiveness for high-density enterprise interfaces

@subsubsection sn_platform Engineering Platform & Infrastructure
- Led SDLC and CI/CD modernization enabling transition from biannual releases to continuous delivery with weekly production deployments
- Established platform infrastructure patterns and governance used across 60+ engineering teams
- Implemented Kong API Gateway and drove API governance strategy for internal and external platform services
- Defined and led Internal Developer Platform (IDP) strategy including Dev Portal architecture, access models, and API onboarding workflows
- Built distributed platform services supporting payments APIs and downstream PSP integrations using AWS, Confluent Cloud (Kafka), Redis, and Postgres
- Partnered with SRE and platform teams to standardize observability practices using Grafana, structured logging, and system-level metrics

@subsubsection sn_dx Developer Experience & Platform Scale
- Delivered reusable platform capabilities that improved authentication patterns, API integration consistency, and frontend/backend interoperability
- Standardized engineering tooling, workflows, and release governance across global teams, reducing integration failures and improving deployment confidence
